        "body1": "Le Peaks is a project that began April 2018. A one man team on a mission to capture and share a noisy sea of memories through sound. With it I hope to lift you from the now, and up there, above the chaos, show you all the little pieces stitched together.",
        "heading2": "Who am I, what is my story?",
        "body2": "A humble web developer to pay the bills. I write music to find meaning. A free spirit, a lone wolf, and a silly man.",
        "heading3": "Influences and topics",
        "body31": "Memories. Old photographs. Echoes and gibberish swirling in my mind. Adulthood, the importance of family and friendship, insignificance and inadequacy, love, the passing of time, and the grey areas between right and wrong. Complex things connected together in a delicate and constantly evolving web.",
        "body32": "I draw inspiration from all sorts of music, from folk songs to church hymns to funk and pop. Electronic music has also lent itself very helpful in capturing my ideas by giving me infinite sound possibilities. All these elements come together to form the music you hear."
